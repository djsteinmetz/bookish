# Open Shelf Books

## The idea
Have you ever looked at a friend or family member and said, "Can I borrow that book?" The mission of Open Shelf Books is to open up your book collection to readers around the world.  

## The ideal workflow
1. A user comes to the homepage to browse books
2. The user finds a book they would like to claim
3. The user registers or logs in (could also be step #2)
4. The user clicks 'redeem' or 'pick'
5. The targeted book owner gets an email/notifictaion stating that someone has claimed their book
6. The book owner then messages the claimant to work out shipping details via messaging (independent from Open Shelf Books)
7. The book owner marks the book as shipped, and transfers ownership of the book to the claimant.  The book is now marked inactive in Open Shelf Books
8. The claimant recieves the book and reads it
9. The claimant finishes the book, and marks it as active again, ready for someone new to claim and enjoy the book!

## Roadmap
MVP has yet to be reached, but future enhancements beyond MVP would include
- Email integration
